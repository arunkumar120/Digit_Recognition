# Digit Recognition Project

This repository contains a Python implementation of a neural network-based digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

The project demonstrates how to preprocess the MNIST dataset, build a simple neural network using TensorFlow/Keras, and evaluate its performance.

## Files
- `digit_recognition.py`: The main script for loading data, training the model, and evaluating it.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script using `python digit_recognition.py`.

## Dataset
The project uses the MNIST dataset, which is automatically downloaded by the script.
